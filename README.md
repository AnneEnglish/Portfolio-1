## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

Best Places to Visit in Waterford is a website where people can gather information
and ideas on places to visit within Waterford. They can choose from different places
by using the navigation bar. If they visit any of the places we have recommended
they can tag us on our Facebook or instagram pages. That way we can gauge what
kind of places are more popular than others, in return we can tailor our website
to suit our users and what they like. If they also have any suggestions they can
contact us through our social media.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Best Places to Visit in Waterford Colour Scheme](assets/readme-images/colourscheme.png)

This website uses an earthy colour palette. The colour palette **image** was created using [Art in Context](https://artincontext.org/color-palette-generator/). The colours were chosen by me for
the website, not by using a colour palette generator.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for all the fonts on the website.
The following fonts were used on the website:

- The header on the page is 'Crimson Text (Bold 700 Italic)', which is a serif font.
- The body area, _including any 'h' elements_ is 'Roboto (Light 300)', which is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

Images used on this site are from Shutterstock or Adobestock (I own an account with them and I am signed up for a free trial with them.) The background images for beaches.html and trails.html are from google images. I have also credited these in the credit section with a link to the images.

### Features

This website contains three pages (home page, beaches, trails), all of which are accessible from the navigation bar.

- All pages on the website contain the following:

  - A responsive navigation bar at the top right of the screen which allows the user to navigate easily through the site. This navigation bar has a burger icon to toggle it.
  - A footer which contains four icons (Gmail, Instagram, Facebook, Youtube) to allow the user to access our social media or contact us whenever they wish to. I used those icons as they are universally recognised and it helps to keep the footer looking clean.
  - All images that are relative to the content shown on the page have an _'alt'_ attribute. The reasons being that incase the image can't be displayed, for SEO and for users that are visually impaired.

### Accessibility

Throughout creating this website I have made sure to make it as accessible as possible by doing the following

- Using descriptive language on image _'alt'_ attributes.
- Providing information for screen readers wherever icons are used on the site.
- Using sematic HTML.
- Ensuring that the colour contrast throughout the site is sufficient.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Libraries and Programs Used

1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
   - Google Fonts were used to import the 'Crimson Text' and 'Roboto' fonts used throughout index.html, beaches.html and trails.html pages by importing them into the style.css, beaches.css and trails.css files.
2. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
   - Font Awesome was used on all pages for the website to add icons for the navigation bar and social media links. It was also used for aesthetic and UX.
3. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Git was used for version control.
4. [Github:](https://github.com/)
   - GitHub was used to store and save the projects code after being pushed from Git.
5. [Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
   - Chrome DevTools was used to test features and fix styling and responsiveness issues.
6. [Online Convert:](https://www.online-convert.com/)
   - Online Convert was used to convert images to WEBP for faster loading times on the site.
7. [Favicon.io:](https://favicon.io/)
   - Favicon.io was used to import icons for the navigation bar and footer icons.
8. [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
   - Am I Responsive was used to show the responsiveness of the website on a range of devices.

## Deployment and Local Development

### Deployment - GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate and click on the GitHub Repository for the project you want to deploy.
3. Locate the 'settings' for the respository. This will be at the top of the repository (**not the top of the page**).
4. Scroll through the settings until you see 'Pages' and click on it. This will be in the navigation bar on the left of your screen.
5. Under the heading 'source' click on the dropdown menu and select 'deploy from branch'.
6. Under the 'branch' heading just below select 'main' from the first dropdown menu, from the second dropdown menu select '/ (root)'
7. After you complete these steps make sure to save. The button for this is to the right of the second dropdown menu.
8. Scroll to the top of the page and you will find the link for the published site.

### Local Development

#### Forking the Github Repository

Forking a GitHub repository is making a copy of the original on our account. We can view/edit without affecting the original repository. Follow the steps below to do this:

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate and click on the GitHub Repository for the project you want to fork.
3. Just below the 'settings' for the respository you will see 'fork'. Click on it and you should now have a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account.

#### Making a Local Clone

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate the GitHub repository for the project you want to clone.
3. Locate and click on the green 'code' button. This should be just below the 'settings'.
4. Choose whether you would like to clone with 'HTTPS', 'SSH' or 'GitHub CLI'.
5. Copy the link after you select one of the options above.
6. Open the terminal for your code editor and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type 'git clone' into the terminal followed by the link you copied in Step 5 (paste the link into terminal).
8. Press 'enter' and your local clone will be created.

## Testing

Testing was constant throughout this project. I used Chrome DevTools to locate any issues I was having while building.

Some of the issues I was having is:

- The main content area being covered by the header on different devices.
- The footer not being pushed to the bottom of the page because I didn't have enough content to fill the page.
- Images not aligning the way I wanted them to.

The WC3 Markup Validator and WC3 CSS Validator were used to validate every page of the project and to ensure there was no errors.

- [WC3 Markup Validator Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fanneenglish.github.io%2)
- [WC3 CSS Validator Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fanneenglish.github.io%2FPortfolio-1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Testing User Stories from UX Section

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- I want to be able to understand the purpose of the site.

  - When entering the site, users are greeted with a clean layout. The main points and purpose are immediately made with the paragraph of text that's in the centre of the page.

- I want to be easily able to navigate through the website.

  - At the top of the page there is a navigation toggle, which is easily recognised as the icon used is one that most websites use. This toggle remains in the same place on all pages and the icon also stays the same. When they get to the bottom of the page they also have the option to go to our social media pages.

- I want to be intrigued and continue browsing through the website.

  - Throughout our website we keep our user intrigued with the colourful and beautiful imagery. We also use descriptive language for the alt tags of these images. Above each image there is information about the location, some of which (_as a local_) I didn't know about and surprised me.

- I want to able to locate their social media and see past places that they have recommended. I also want to see vlogs they have posted on their Youtube.

  - Our socal media accounts are easily accessible to the user by the icons we have used, which are universally recognised. They are placed in the footer and the bottom of all pages. They also contain an aria-label attribute.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- I want to find new recommendations for the month.

  - We state on our homepage that our recommendations get updated every Monday. Therefore if the user visits our site on Monday or after, they will see the most up to date recommendations.

- I want to be able to find out how to contact them with any suggestions I have or any questions I have.

  - We also state on our homepage that the user can contact us through our social media, which is located in the footer of our page.

#### Frequent Vistor Goals

- I want to be able to contact them with suggestions and submit my own photos for them to use on their website if they would like to.

  - Users have the option to contact us and submit photos through Gmail, Facebook or Instagram.

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of devices with no issues.

  - Our website was created using the 'mobile first' approach, we then tailord it with media queries so that it responds well to a range of devices.

- To make it clear to visitors what the purpose of the site is for.

- We make it very clear on our homepage what the purpose of the site is for. The SEO also helps to make it clear what the site is for as the user would have searched for keywords that would cause our page to show up.

- To allow visitors to submit suggestions if they would like to.

- We allow our visitors to contact us through a range of social media, so they can choose one that suits them best. We also accept suggestions through said social media accounts.

### Further Testing

- The website was tested on a range of web browsers and responded well to each of them. **Some** of the web browsers we have tested on were Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge.

- Friends, family and coworkers were asked to view the website and provide feedback. This proved well as there were some bugs pointed out that I have since fixed.

- The website was viewed on a range of devices such as:

  - iPhone 13
  - Samsung Galaxy s10e
  - Samsung Galaxy A70
  - iPhone 11
  - HP Stream 14s
  - Apple MacBook Pro
  - Samsung Galaxy Tab A8

- A large amount of the testing went into making sure that all the HTML pages and CSS pages were linking correctly and that there was no layout issues or pixelation of images.

### Known Bugs

- On some mobiles the main content area pulls closer to the header but is not covered by it.
- When testing through lighthouse the performance for some pages on the site drops due to the images no being sized properly (not being compressed). When I compress the images and put them back in the performance drops more, even though I have compressed the images. I know this issue is due to the file size as I have looked into it and there is a separate issue for the ratio of the images.

## Credits

### Code

- On line 102 through to 108 of the style.css page was taken from [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.tmpl#viewport3) with the exception of deleting some of the code to better suit what I needed it to do.
- Some parts of code in style.css, beaches.css and trails.css was taken from my 'Love Running' project. Lines 3 through to 28 is where you'll find this code, with the exception of tailoring some of it to better suit my project. Lines 3 through to 12 were not altered.

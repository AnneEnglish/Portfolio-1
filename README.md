## User Experience

Best Places to Visit in Waterford is a website where people can gather information
and ideas on places to visit within Waterford. They can choose from different places
by using the navigation bar. If they visit any of the places we have recommended
they can tag us on our Facebook or instagram pages. That way we can gauge what
kind of places are more popular than others, in return we can tailor our website
to suit our users and what they like. If they also have any suggestions they can
contact us through our social media.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Best Places to Visit in Waterford Colour Scheme](assets/readme-images/colourscheme.png)

This website uses an earthy colour palette. The colour palette **image** was created using [Art in Context](https://artincontext.org/color-palette-generator/). The colours were chosen by me for
the website, not by using a colour palette generator.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for all the fonts on the website.
The following fonts were used on the website:

- The header on the page is 'Crimson Text (Bold 700 Italic)', which is a serif font.
- The body area, _including any 'h' elements_ is 'Roboto (Light 300)', which is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

Images used on this site are from Shutterstock or Adobestock (I own an account with them and I am signed up for a free trial with them.) The background images for beaches.html and trails.html are from google images. I have also credited these in the credit section with a link to the images.

### Features

This website contains three pages (home page, beaches, trails), all of which are accessible from the navigation bar.

- All pages on the website contain the following:

  - A responsive navigation bar at the top right of the screen which allows the user to navigate easily through the site. This navigation bar has a burger icon to toggle it.
  - A footer which contains three icons (Instagram, Facebook, Youtube) to allow the user to access our social media or contact us whenever they wish to. I used those icons as they are universally recognised and it helps to keep the footer looking clean.
  - All images that are relative to the content shown on the page have an _'alt'_ attribute. The reasons being that incase the image can't be displayed, for SEO and for users that are visually impaired.

### Accessibility

Throughout creating this website I have made sure to make it as accessible as possible by doing the following

- Using descriptive language on image _'alt'_ attributes.
- Providing information for screen readers wherever icons are used on the site.
- Using sematic HTML.
- Ensuring that the colour contrast throughout the site is sufficient.

## Technologies Used

### Libraries and Programs Used

## Deployment and Local Development

### Deployment - GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate and click on the GitHub Repository for the project you want to deploy.
3. Locate the 'settings' for the respository. This will be at the top of the repository (**not the top of the page**).
4. Scroll through the settings until you see 'Pages' and click on it. This will be in the navigation bar on the left of your screen.
5. Under the heading 'source' click on the dropdown menu and select 'deploy from branch'.
6. Under the 'branch' heading just below select 'main' from the first dropdown menu, from the second dropdown menu select '/ (root)'
7. After you complete these steps make sure to save. The button for this is to the right of the second dropdown menu.
8. Scroll to the top of the page and you will find the link for the published site.

### Local Development

#### Forking the Github Repository

Forking a GitHub repository is making a copy of the original on our account. We can view/edit without affecting the original repository. Follow the steps below to do this:

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate and click on the GitHub Repository for the project you want to fork.
3. Just below the 'settings' for the respository you will see 'fork'. Click on it and you should now have a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account.

#### Making a Local Clone

1. Log into [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Locate the GitHub repository for the project you want to clone.
3. Locate and click on the green 'code' button. This should be just below the 'settings'.
4. Choose whether you would like to clone with 'HTTPS', 'SSH' or 'GitHub CLI'.
5. Copy the link after you select one of the options above.
6. Open the terminal for your code editor and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type 'git clone' into the terminal followed by the link you copied in Step 5 (paste the link into terminal).
8. Press 'enter' and your local clone will be created.

## Testing

Testing was constant throughout this project. I used Chrome DevTools to locate any issues I was having while building.

Some of the issues I was having is:

- The main content area being covered by the header on different devices.
- The footer not being pushed to the bottom of the page because I didn't have enough content to fill the page.
- Images not aligning the way I wanted them to.

The WC3 Markup Validator and WC3 CSS Validator were used to validate every page of the project and to ensure there was no errors.

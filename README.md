## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Best Places to Visit in Waterford Colour Scheme](assets/readme-images/colourscheme.png)

This website uses an earthy colour palette. The colour palette **image** was created using [Art in Context](https://artincontext.org/color-palette-generator/). The colours were chosen by me for
the website, not by using a colour palette generator.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for all the fonts on the website.
The following fonts were used on the website:

- The header on the page is 'Crimson Text (Bold 700 Italic)', which is a serif font.
- The body area, _including any 'h' elements_ is 'Roboto (Light 300)', which is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

Images used on this site are from Shutterstock or Adobestock (I own an account with them and I am signed up for a free trial with them.) The background images for beaches.html and trails.html are from google images. I have also credited these in the credit section with a link to the images.

### Features

This website contains three pages (home page, beaches, trails), all of which are accessible from the navigation bar.

- All pages on the website contain the following:

  - A responsive navigation bar at the top right of the screen which allows the user to navigate easily through the site. This navigation bar has a burger icon to toggle it.
  - A footer which contains three icons (Instagram, Facebook, Youtube) to allow the user to access our social media or contact us whenever they wish to. I used those icons as they are universally recognised and it helps to keep the footer looking clean.
  - All images that are relative to the content shown on the page have an _'alt'_ attribute. The reasons being that incase the image can't be displayed, for SEO and for users that are visually impaired.

### Accessibility

Throughout creating this website I have made sure to make it as accessible as possible by doing the following

- Using descriptive language on image _'alt'_ attributes.
- Providing information for screen readers wherever icons are used on the site.
- Using sematic HTML.
- Ensuring that the colour contrast throughout the site is sufficient.

   - Font Awesome was used on all pages for the website to add icons for the navigation bar and social media links. It was also used for aesthetic and UX.

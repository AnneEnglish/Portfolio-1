        <h2><em>On the hunt for trails and scenic views in Waterford? Look no further! </em></h2>
        <p>No matter what you're looking for, you can find a huge range of trails in Waterford to suit you. </p>
        <div class="trails">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3><span>1. <u>Coumshingaun Lough</u></span></h3>
                    <p>This trail is one our favourites, the view from above is amazing. It is recommended to have some
                        hiking experience before attempting to do this trail as it is a very strenuous route. It is also
                        recommended that you download the offline map as this route is not signposted very well. You
                        should <u>not</u>do this trail unless you have thoroughly planned beforehand. <img

                            class="images"></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span>2. <u>Dunmore East Cliff Walk</u></span></h3>
                    <p>This clifftop trail is most certainly up there in our top 5 for Waterford. It is well maintained
                        and easily accessible (<em>to most</em>). This route has some of the most breathtaking views of
                        the Waterford coastline. Please be aware that during the wetter months it can get really muddy
                        so it's best to come prepared wearing the appropiate footwear. <img

                    <h3>3. <u>Waterford Greenway</u></h3>
                    <p>The Waterford Greenway also known as the 'DÃ©ise Greenway' is 45.2km long (<em>Waterford to
                            Dungarvan</em>). This is a popular trail for walking, running or cycling. It is very simple
                        to follow too. The greenway takes you to some of Ireland's most interesting historic sites.
                        These include Viking sites, medieval ruins, Norman castles, old railway stations, famine
                        workhouses and an Ice Age rock. <img src="assets/images/greenway.webp"
                            alt="A picture of an earthy part of the Greenway in Waterford" class="images"></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span>4. <u>Tramore Sand Dunes</u></span></h3>
                    <p>The Tramore Sand Dunes Walk/Tramore Strand Loop is 7.4km long. It is considered to be an easy
                        enough route too. The sand dunes in Tramore are some of the highest in Ireland, backed by a salt
                        marsh and is home to some rare seaside plants and interesting wildlife. The Back Strand is a
                        bird sanctuary and at low tide you will see many wading birds feeding on the sand banks <img

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><span>5. <u>Anne Valley</u></span></h3>
                    <p>The Anne Valley Walk was developed by the local landowners and community. The walk is fully
                        accessible to those with reduced mobility, including wheelchairs, buggies etc. It follows the
                        Anne river flowing through protected wildlife areas of forest and marshland. About halfway
                        between Dunhill and Annestown coast on this route you will see the stunning views of Dunhill
                        Castle. <img src="assets/images/dunhill_castle.webp"
